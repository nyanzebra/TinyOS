# TinyOS [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nyanzebra/TinyOS.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nyanzebra/TinyOS) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/nyanzebra/TinyOS/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/nyanzebra/TinyOS?branch=master)

## Why make an OS?
Because it is fun, and it will be cool to make an OS that has a small foot print and that I can use eventually for developing other projects

## Why use C++?
C++ is a strong choice for making an OS; it provides object encapsulation for making data-structures (as opposed to C or using traits/impl + macros in Rust), is still ridiculously fast, and has templates!  

## What will be included?
I would like to reach the following:
- Filesystem
- Threads/Process
- Context switching
- Concurrency
- Networking
- System calls
- Scheduling (a bit related to above :P)
- Light GUI?
- Extensible API into Python?
